**Build Your Own Blogging Software** is a hands-on coding challenge designed to guide you through the process of building a simple yet functional blogging platform from scratch. The project will help you learn the essentials of web development by creating a blog where you can write, edit, and manage posts, and where readers can engage with your content through comments.

### Why Build a Blog?

Blogs have been a cornerstone of the internet since the early 2000s, transforming static web pages into dynamic platforms for sharing ideas, tutorials, and personal stories. By building your own blogging software, you will:

- **Understand Web Development Fundamentals**: Learn how to serve static web pages, handle dynamic content, and manage user interactions.
- **Gain Experience with Templates**: Discover how to use templates to render content consistently across your site.
- **Manage Content Creation**: Create an admin interface where you can draft, edit, and publish posts with ease.
- **Work with Databases**: Explore the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, and implement one to store and retrieve your blog posts.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Implement features like commenting, RSS feeds, and post scheduling to make your blog more interactive and engaging.

### What You'll Build

Throughout this challenge, you will build a blogging platform with the following features:

- **Serve Static Web Pages**: Start by serving a basic HTML page from your server.
- **Dynamic Content with Templates**: Use templates to render your blog posts and other content dynamically.
- **Admin Interface**: Create a secure admin section where you can write, edit, and manage your blog posts.
- **Markdown Support**: Allow users to write posts using Markdown, making it easy to format content.
- **Database Integration**: Store your posts in a database, either SQL or NoSQL, and retrieve them as needed.
- **Commenting System**: Enable readers to leave comments on your posts, fostering engagement.
- **Advanced Features**: Optionally add RSS feeds, template editing, and post scheduling.

By the end of this challenge, you'll have a fully functional blog that you can customize, extend, and share with others.
